    "\n",
    "#### Basic information about the downloaded dataset<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Number of reviews: 568,454<br>\n",
    "Number of users: 256,059<br>\n",
    "Number of products: 74,258<br>\n",
    "Timespan: Oct 1999 - Oct 2012<br>\n",
    "Number of Attributes/Columns in data: 10 \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Attribute Information:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Id\n",
    "2. ProductId - unique identifier for the product\n",
    "3. UserId - unqiue identifier for the user\n",
    "4. ProfileName\n",
    "5. HelpfulnessNumerator - number of users who found the review helpful\n",
    "6. HelpfulnessDenominator - number of users who indicated whether they found the review helpful or not\n",
    "7. Score - rating between 1 and 5\n",
    "8. Time - timestamp for the review\n",
    "9. Summary - brief summary of the review\n",
    "10. Text - text of the review\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objective:\n",
    "Our main objective for this analysis is to train a model which can seperate the postive and negative reviews.\n",
    "In this problem we will apply classification techniques called Random Forest and Gradient Boosted Decision Trees to get an idea if the data can be seperated based on its polarity, i.e. if the review is positive or negative. By looking at the Score column we can make out that the review is positive or not. But we don't need to implement any ML here. A simple if-else condition will make us do this. So for this problem, we will put our focus on to the Review text. The text is the most important feature here if you may ask. Based on the review text we will build a prediction model and determine if a future review is positive or negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### While pre-processing the original dataset we have taken into consideration the following points.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We will classify a review to be positive if and only if the corresponding Score for the given review is 4 or 5.\n",
    "2. We will classify a review to be negative if and only if the corresponding Score for the given review is 1 or 2.\n",
    "3. We will ignore the reviews for the time being which has a Score rating of 3. Because 3 can be thought of as a neutral review. It's neither negative nor positive.\n",
    "4. We will remove the duplicate entries from the dataset. \n",
    "5. We will train our final mdel using four featurizations -> bag of words model, tf-idf model, average word-to-vec model and tf-idf weighted word-to-vec model.\n",
    "6. So at end of the training the model will be trained on the above four featurizations to determine if a given review is positive or negative (Determining the sentiment polarity of the Amazon reviews)"

    "1. Begin by removing the html tags\n",
    "2. Remove any punctuations or limited set of special characters like , or . or # etc.\n",
    "3. Check if the word is made up of english letters and is not alpha-numeric\n",
    "4. Check to see if the length of the word is greater than 2 (as it was researched that there is no adjective in 2-letters)\n",
    "5. Convert the word to lowercase\n",
    "6. Remove Stopwords\n",

    "## [4.1] BAG OF WORDS\n",
    "\n",
    "A bag-of-words model, or BoW for short, is a way of extracting features from text for use in modeling, such as with machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "The approach is very simple and flexible, and can be used in a myriad of ways for extracting features from documents. Suppose we have N reviews in our dataset and we want to convert the words in our reviews to vectors. We can use BOW as a method to do this. What it does is that for each unique word in the data corpus, it creates a dimension. Then it counts how many number of times a word is present in a review. And then this number is placed under that word for a corresponding review. We will get a Sparse Matrix representation for all the worods inthe review.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at this example of 2 reviews below :\n",
    "\n",
    "r1 = {\"The food is great, ambience is great\"} and  </br>r2 = {\"I love this food\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "At first the words will be extracted from r1 and r2.\n",
    "\n",
    "r1' = {\"The\", \"food\", \"is\", \"great\", \"ambience\", \"is\", \"great\"} and r2' = {\"I\", \"love\", \"this\", \"food\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "Now using r1' and r2' we will create a vector of unique words -> V =  {\"The\", \"food\", \"is\", \"great\", \"ambience\", \"I\", \"love\", \"this\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "Now here's how the vector representation will look like for each reviews r1 and r2, when we make use of the vector 'V' created above.\n",
    "\n",
    "r1_vector = [1,1,2,2,1,0,0,0] and r2_vector = [0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1]\n",
    "\n",
    "In r1 since, \"great\" and \"is\" occurs twice, we have set the count to 2. If a words doesn't occur in a review we will set the count to 0. Although \"is\" a stopword, the example above is intended to make you understand how bag of words work.\n",

    "\n",
    "In information retrieval, tf–idf or TFIDF, short for term frequency–inverse document frequency, is a numerical statistic that is intended to reflect how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume we have data corpus D, which contains N reviews {r1,r2,r3,r4...rN}. Let's say our review r1 contains the following words {w1,w2,w3,w1,w9,w6,w7,w9,w9}.\n",
    "\n",
    "TF or Term Frequency for a word is basically the number of times a word occurs in a review divided by the total number of words present in that same review.\n",
    "For example, in the text corpus that we have considered in the above example, the TF for word w1 is (2/9) and for word w9 is (1/3). Intuitively, higher the occurence of a word in a text is, greater will be its TF value. TF values lies between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "IDF or Inverse Document Frequency for a word is given by the formula log(N/n), where 'N' is equal to the total number of reviews in the corpus 'D' and 'n' refers to the number of reviews in 'D' which contains that specific word. Intuitively, IDF will be higher for words which occur rarely and will be less for words which occurs more frequently. IDF values are more than 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "So for each word in each review we will consider the product of (TF x IDF), and represent it in a d dimensional vector. \n",
    "\n",
    "TF-IDF basically doesn't consider the semantic meaning of words. But what is does is that it gives more importance to words which occurs less frequently in the whole data corpus and also gives much importance to the most frequent words that occurs in each review."
